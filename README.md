**Sign-Language-To-Text-and-Speech-Conversion**

**ABSTRACT:** 

 Sign language is one of the oldest and most natural form of language for communication, hence we have come up with a real time method using neural networks for finger spelling based American sign language. Automatic human gesture recognition from camera images is an interesting topic for developing vision. We propose a convolution neural network (CNN) method to recognize hand gestures of human actions from an image captured by camera. The purpose is to recognize hand gestures of human task activities from a camera image. The position of hand and orientation are applied to obtain the training and testing data for the CNN. The hand is first passed through a filter and after the filter is applied where the hand is passed through a classifier which predicts the class of the hand gestures. Then the calibrated images are used to train CNN.

 
In our project we basically focus on producing a model which can recognise Fingerspelling based hand gestures in order to form a complete word by combining each gesture. The gestures we aim to train are as given in the image below. 


**Text To Speech Translation:**

The model translates known gestures into words. we have used pyttsx3 library to convert the recognized words into the appropriate speech. The text-to-speech output is a simple workaround, but it's a useful feature because it simulates a real-life dialogue.
